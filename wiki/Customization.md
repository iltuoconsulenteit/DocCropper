# Customization

The appearance of DocCropper can be changed by editing files in the `static/` directory. Replace images in `static/logos/` to customize branding and update `settings.json` to change default behavior.

To add your own HTML snippet to the header, set the `brand_html` field in `settings.json`. This will appear in the branding box on the right side of the header.

Translations live in `static/lang/`. Modify these files or add new ones to support more languages.
