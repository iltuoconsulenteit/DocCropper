# Installation

DocCropper can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The recommended approach is to use the provided installer scripts which will clone the repository, set up the Python environment, and optionally configure your license key.

## Windows

Run:

```cmd
install\install_DocCropper.bat
```

## Linux/macOS

Run:

```bash
bash install/install_DocCropper.sh
```

The installer logs its progress to a file in your temporary folder so you can inspect it later.
