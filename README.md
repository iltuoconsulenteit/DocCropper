# 📄 DocCropper

**DocCropper** is a web-based application for document image perspective correction, cropping, and PDF export. It is designed to work both locally and in LAN environments, including touchscreen or kiosk-style workstations.

This project is **inspired by [image-perspective-crop](https://github.com/varna9000/image-perspective-crop)**, but has been **significantly rewritten and extended**, with major architectural changes, a redesigned user interface, batch features, user preferences, and many additional capabilities.

## 🔧 Frontend

This project uses [Interact.JS](https://github.com/taye/interact.js) for managing draggable corner points.

The frontend allows the user to:
- Upload one or more images (on mobile devices the file picker can use the camera directly)
- Manually adjust the four corners of each image
- Submit data (image, coordinates, size) to the backend
- Export all processed images to PDF
- Choose how many processed images appear on each PDF page
- Select portrait or landscape orientation for the PDF
- Choose whether images are arranged horizontally, vertically or in a grid and preview the layout before exporting
- Control how images are scaled on each page: fill the cell, keep original size or apply a custom percentage
- A small margin is applied around each image so nothing touches the page edges
- Change the interface language (Italian translation included)
- The layout is responsive so DocCropper works well on smartphones and tablets

JavaScript logic is contained in `static/app.js`.

**Data sent to backend:**
- `original_height`, `original_width`: dimensions of the image
- `points`: coordinates of the 4 corners (TL, TR, BR, BL)
- `image_file`: the uploaded file

Images are processed and displayed as thumbnails with **Rotate**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons. Preview and layout configuration options are also provided before export.

Logos and branding can be customized via `static/logos/`, `settings.json`, and `brand_html`. The footer displays the current Git commit hash.

User preferences are stored in the `users/` folder based on their email address. Anonymous users fallback to global settings in `settings.json`. The system supports optional Google sign-in and a configurable payment box (donation or subscription). Developer keys allow full access and can be defined in `settings.json` or `.env`.

## 🐍 Backend

Built with **FastAPI + Uvicorn**, the backend:
- Applies a perspective transformation and cropping
- Optionally sharpens the image
- Compiles all processed images into a PDF with layout control
- Handles per-session temporary folders

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🧱 Create virtual environment

```bash
cd doccropper
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate     # On Linux/macOS

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🛠 Installer Scripts

- Set up the environment
- Ask for optional license key
- Launch the server or tray icon

You can pre-populate `settings.json` or override values using `.env` files in the `env/` folder.

## ▶️ Running DocCropper

Use the included start scripts from the `scripts/` directory. They handle virtualenv creation and dependency install.

To stop the server, run the matching stop script or send a POST to `/shutdown/`.

You may also launch `doccropper_tray.py` (or `.pyw`) to manage the server with a system tray icon.
