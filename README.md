# DocCropper

üóÇÔ∏è *DocCropper* is a fork of [`varna9000/image-perspective-crop`](https://github.com/varna9000/image-perspective-crop), enhanced to support:

- ‚úÖ Multi-image upload
- üìê Batch perspective correction
- üìÑ Export to PDF
- üß∞ LAN-ready setup for document stations

## üîß Frontend

This project uses [Interact.JS](https://github.com/taye/interact.js) for managing draggable corner points.

The frontend allows the user to:
- Upload one or more images
- Manually adjust the four corners of each image
- Submit data (image, coordinates, size) to the backend
- Export all processed images to PDF
- Choose how many processed images appear on each PDF page
- Select portrait or landscape orientation for the PDF
- Choose whether images are arranged horizontally, vertically or in a grid and preview the layout before exporting
- Control how images are scaled on each page: fill the cell, keep original size or apply a custom percentage.
  When using **Original** or **100%** the generator now adjusts for the image's
  DPI so photos scanned at 150‚Äì200 DPI render closer to real size on a 300 DPI
  PDF page.
- A small margin is applied around each image so nothing touches the page edges
- Change the interface language (Italian translation included)

All JavaScript is contained in `static/app.js`.

### Data sent to backend:
- `original_height`, `original_width`: dimensions of the image
- `points`: coordinates of the 4 corners (TL, TR, BR, BL)
- `image_file`: the uploaded file

After all images are processed, choose how many images appear on each page, how they are scaled, the page orientation and the image arrangement. A small preview updates to reflect your choices before you use **Export PDF** to download.
The interface includes small placeholder logos encoded directly in the HTML. Replace these `data:` URIs with your own branding. Place your own images inside `static/logos/` and reference them from `static/index.html`.
The expected filenames are `header_logo.png` for the top banner and `footer_logo.png` for the footer. If these files are missing, the placeholders will be used automatically.
Default preferences for language, PDF layout, page orientation and scaling are stored in `settings.json`. Any change you make through the interface is saved back to this file via the `/settings` API.
Without a valid license the exported PDF shows a large "DEMO" watermark from the second page onward. For testing or demonstrations you may use a developer key placed in `settings.json` or provided via the `DOCROPPER_DEV_LICENSE` environment variable.
Language JSON files live in `static/lang/`. Add additional translations by creating new `<code>lang.json</code>` files and updating the language selector.
Processed images appear as thumbnails. Each thumbnail offers **Rotate**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons so you can refine the results. Click a thumbnail itself to view it in a modal overlay.

## üêç Backend

Implemented with **FastAPI** + **Uvicorn**, the backend:

- Applies a perspective transformation
- Crops the image to corrected bounds
- Applies optional sharpening filter
- Saves or returns the corrected image
- Compiles all processed images into a single **PDF**, arranging up to four per page
- Supports portrait or landscape page orientation; when using two images per page, landscape arranges them horizontally
- Images can be scaled per page: fill the cell, keep original size or apply a custom percentage
- A margin is always kept around each image so they don't run into the edges when printed

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### üß± Create virtual environment

```bash
cd doccropper
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate     # On Linux/macOS

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You could use other server-side languages or tools for this processing (e.g. Imagemagick).

### üõ† Install script

Run `install/install_DocCropper.sh` on Linux or macOS (or double-click `install/install_DocCropper.command` on macOS) and `install/install_DocCropper.bat` on Windows from the folder where you want the project. If the script lives inside an existing clone under `install/` it updates that copy; otherwise it creates a new `DocCropper` subfolder next to the script. Both versions verify that `git`, `python3`/`python` and `pip3`/`pip` are available before pulling the latest changes with `--rebase --autostash`.

After cloning or updating, the installer optionally asks for a license key. Leaving it blank keeps the application in demo mode. When a key and licensee name are supplied they are stored in `settings.json` so the interface shows "Licensed to &lt;name&gt;".

The application reads configuration from `settings.json` in the project root. You can pre-populate this file with your preferred defaults or edit it later.
A small status box in the interface shows "DEMO" or "Licensed to &lt;name&gt;" based on these settings.

## üîì Licensing and commercial version

**DocCropper** is released under the [MIT](LICENSE.txt) license. Without a valid key the software runs in **DEMO** mode. PDFs exported in demo mode keep a large "DEMO" watermark from the second page onward, though you can still upload multiple images.

### üíº PRO features

- removal of the watermark on multipage PDFs
- OCR modules and saving to network folders (in development)
- LAN access with authentication

### üí∞ Pricing and activation

Purchasing a PRO license provides a `license.key` file and the registered licensee name. Placing this file in the project folder shows "Licensed to <name>" in the interface and unlocks all features.

### üîë Developer key

For demonstrations and testing you can temporarily unlock all PRO features by placing the developer key in the `license_key` field of `settings.json` or by setting the `DOCROPPER_DEV_LICENSE` environment variable. The actual key is provided separately and is not shown here for security reasons.
